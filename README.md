# manymessage

Hi! This is a simple program that sends a message to many people all at once. (Or at least in very, very quick succession.)

## Installation

You can install with RubyGems or Homebrew!

For Homebrew:

```shell
brew install jltml/tap/manymessage
```

For RubyGems:

```shell
gem install manymessage
```

## Usage

Here's an example:
```shell
manymessage --to input_names.txt --message message.txt
```

`input_names.txt` (or whatever you name the file) should be a plain-text list of names, like First Last, with a name on each line. Manymessage will download and run [contacts-cli](https://github.com/pepebecker/contacts-cli) to get all your contacts, then will filter them according to the names in the aforementioned text file before pairing each name with that person's phone number. Then, it uses the [imessage gem](https://github.com/linjunpop/imessage) to send your message to each person, which in turn actually uses AppleScript.

`message.txt` isâ€¦ surprise, the message you'd like to send (it also doesn't have to be named `message.txt`)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
